Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree Project 2: Data Pagination and Filtering

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to dynamically paginate a large collection of student data and enhance the usability of adirectory

The project takes a list of 42 students and splits them into pages of 9 students. Buttons are dynamically added at the bottom of the page and allow the user to navigate through the different pages of students. An interactive search filter also allows the user to search for students. Search results and pagination are adjusted based on the amount of results returned.
